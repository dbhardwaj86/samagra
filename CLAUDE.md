# SAMAGRA (repo & Python package = `samagra`) — project notes

> **Naming:** the working directory is still `TeachingOS/` (legacy), but the **repo, the GitHub remote and the
> Python package are `samagra`** since the Phase-0 rename (2026-06-19). Where the auto-generated memory block
> below still says "TeachingOS", read it as the legacy directory / historical name only.
>
> **▶▶▶▶▶▶ ✅ CONTENT-FACTORY PIVOT — RATIFIED 2026-06-23 by Deepak (Founder & Chairman, carte blanche). NEW TOP
> DIRECTION.** SAMAGRA converts from a **static read-only operator console** into an **active, style-conditioned,
> multi-output content factory** for JEE/NEET **physics**: ONE seed (a lecture/chapter, a question, a captured idea)
> fans out to a wide spread of catalogued/indexed/categorized content types, in Deepak's style, behind the
> never-automated publish gate. **The reframe = activation, not teardown:** the 2026-06-19 spec already designed +
> parked this machinery — A6 (a learner-facing product is a SEPARATE entity consuming the published corpus), the
> dormant DRAFTER + ONE adversarial REVIEWER (anchored only to external ground-truth; catch-rate→0 = red flag), and
> the demand compass. The pivot ACTIVATES those + generalizes the bridge's single write into a many-output dispatch.
> **Decisions (binding):** **DEC-7** bridge → guarded **dispatch** boundary (1 approved seed → N child assignments,
> each board-approved + single-write + terminal; an EXTENSION that strengthens the firewall; needs a Codex pre-merge
> review of the new boundary); **DEC-8** **StyleSeed** = durable owner-curated voice profile from the 59 chapters,
> advisory style-fit scoring (never auto-advances the gate), owner-ratified learning loop over `review_overlay`;
> **DEC-9** **PRATHAM** student twin = the A6 separate entity, DEFERRED (DEC-1 "no audience" scoped to the console
> only). **4 forks ratified:** (1) **dispatch spine first** (throughput; StyleSeed layers after the deterministic
> lanes), (2) **PRATHAM deferred to Phase G**, (3) **publish gate = per-seed batch** (`approve_seed` — never silent
> auto-approve; mandatory adversarial review on LLM lanes), (4) **scope = teaching leverage** (no GTM; multi-seed
> from day one). **PRESERVED & still binding:** the never-automated publish gate; the read-only firewall over the 7
> source subsystems (munshi/mcd/QX/textbook/booklets/INSP/sims); the 5 crash-safety guards; DEC-1 bounded console
> scope. **Plan A–G** (spine → deterministic lanes → StyleSeed → coverage graph → async lanes → deferred PRATHAM).
> **Phase 1 = `samagra/factory/` dispatch spine + 2 deterministic local-write lanes (`revision`/`lecture`) from a
> textbook-chapter seed — NO new prod write path** (strictly safer than the existing bridge); reuses existing
> `assignments` columns (`pipeline`=lane, `seed_ref`, `artifact_ref`) so **no migration**. Spec
> `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-06-23-samagra-content-factory-design.md`; Phase-1 plan
> `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-06-23-samagra-content-factory-phase1-dispatch.md`; Chairman vision
> `CONTENT-FACTORY-VISION.html`. Synthesis from a 16-agent Workflow (run `wf_5fb88c46-838`). **Not yet built** —
> Phase 1 is the next executable unit (TDD, subagent-driven, Codex pre-merge review per DEC-7).
>
> **✅ Direction-coherence decision (ratified 2026-06-21 by Deepak; amended by DEC-6 on 2026-06-22):** a coherence
> audit found execution solid but the strategic direction drifting — "SAMAGRA OS" had re-introduced the OS-sized
> scope the 2026-06-19 vision deliberately retired. **Decided & binding:** SAMAGRA OS is a *bounded operator
> console* (UI metaphor only); a scope firewall is in force (DEC-1/DEC-3); the never-automated publish gate holds;
> Phase 3 (active loop) is the primary value engine (DEC-5). **⚠ DEC-6 (2026-06-22, Chairman): the pre-E3
> attention-ROI gate (DEC-4) is RETIRED** (not deferred), and the **attention-ROI north-star + kill-criterion
> (DEC-2) are relaxed from binding to advisory** — E3 + the public deploy shipped ahead of the gate and the
> bounded console is judged already proven; Phase 3 is now ungated. See `HANDOFF.md` →
> *✅ Direction-coherence DECISION* (DEC-1…DEC-6) and `STATUS.html` → *Direction coherence*.
>
> **✅ DEC-3 AMENDMENT (2026-06-21, Chairman):** the read-only firewall is amended to allow **owner-initiated
> capture** — exactly two **subsystem** write paths, `POST /api/munshi/capture` (munshi item) and `POST /api/mcd/seeds`
> (mcd seed). The human **publish gate stays never-automated**, there is **no munshi→mcd bridge**, and the
> invariant is now *"read-only except owner-initiated capture."* The capture control plane is **live-verified**
> on branch `feature/control-plane-capture` (capture apps read the live workers via `GET /api/munshi/library` +
> `GET /api/mcd/seeds`; Simulations shows the 482 deployed pratyaksh sims; the QX browser facet bug is fixed).
> See `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-06-21-samagra-control-plane-capture-design.md`.
>
> **✅ PHASE 3 — ACTIVE LOOP (the bridge) BUILT + MERGED to `main` + PUSHED to `origin/main` 2026-06-23**
> (ff `88d31e0`; pushed HEAD `1c5ec5d`), per the
> reconciled `docs/superpowers/{specs/2026-06-22-phase3-active-loop-design.md,plans/2026-06-22-phase3-active-loop.md}`.
> `samagra/bridge/` + CLI `samagra bridge scan|approve|submit`: munshi item → classify → propose seed + pointers →
> `in-review` board assignment → **manual `approve`** → **manual `submit`** (creates the mcd seed). **Governance
> consistency:** this is the **board-approved, owner-driven** munshi→seed loop of spec §8/§9.4 — it is **NOT** the
> *automated* munshi→mcd promotion DEC-3 forbade (every seed needs an explicit human approve+submit), it adds **NO
> new subsystem write path** (`submit` reuses the existing `create_seed` behind `POST /api/mcd/seeds`; still exactly
> two write paths) and **no new web endpoint**, and the **never-automated publish gate is untouched**. It was
> **explicitly directed by the Chairman** ("go for phase 3"), the action DEC-3 reserved, and is DEC-5's primary
> value engine (ungated by DEC-6). Golden thread proven live (seed `seed_01KVRFPPT98HJVQ5NRBJ63MKR3`). **Codex
> pre-merge review done:** review 22 returned **NO-GO** (prod double-write robustness) → all findings remediated TDD
> (H3 scan dedups status-blind incl. terminal `captured`; H1 fail-safe `seed_submitting` intent guard refuses a
> crashed/in-flight retry; M1 `validate_seed_payload` at the write boundary; M2 graceful munshi-down; Low
> word-boundary classify + full-id outbox guard) → re-review 23 **GO-WITH-CAVEATS, all 6 resolved** (H2 concurrent
> submit accepted Low under the single-operator manual-CLI threat model). Gate **272 pytest** (was 263).
